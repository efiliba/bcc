# Best Choice Care

A React / Node.js based web site where carers can register their details for prospective clients to match.

Built on [mern-starter](http://mern.io) for the configuration and isomophic boilerplate.

## Structure

The application has been separated into this web-site and an API hosted on the Google Cloud Platform using Google App Engine (GAE).
The API stores uploaded avatars using Google's Cloud Storage so that they can be served statically.
